tools in my locker

The purpose of this repository is to store build artefacts. What do I mean by that? Well scripts, binaries, that I have used over the years to help build development environments. This is a practice I have used for many years now and decided that I should make it public.

I've worked on many sorts of environments, from Windows c#.Net to Linux Ruby so there should be a good mix.

There has been many debates over the years over single repositories or multiple and what the lines of segregation should be. For the moment I will use a single repository which will in this instance contain all sorts of stuff.

I have no idea if this will be of help to anyone, all comments are welcome on what you see.

Of course there have been fellow colleagues who have contributed along the way so I'd like to thank Jianping Zhou, Andrew Oji, Robert Oles, Robert A'court, Emeka Eluwae and Scott Duke.
